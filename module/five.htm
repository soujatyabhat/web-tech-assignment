    <h3> <u> XML (Extensible Markup Language)   </u></h3>
    <p> XML is a versatile text-based format used for structuring and transporting data. Unlike HTML, which is designed to display data, XML is designed to store and transport data, making it a cornerstone of web services and data interchange across different systems. Its flexibility allows users to define their own tags, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications from configuration files to data representation in APIs. XML ensures both human and machine readability, facilitating data sharing and manipulation in a platform-independent manner. </p>
