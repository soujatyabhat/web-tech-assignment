    <h3> <u> JavaScript DOM  </u></h3>
    <p> The JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that allows developers to interact with and manipulate the structure, content, and styling of web documents. It represents the document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text. Using DOM methods, developers can dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page, respond to user events, and create interactive web applications. The DOM is essential for modern web development, enabling real-time updates and enhanced user experiences. </p>
