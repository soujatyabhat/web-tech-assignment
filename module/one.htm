    <h3> <u> Introduction to Web Technologies  </u></h3>
    <p> Web technologies refer to the tools and techniques used for creating and managing websites and web applications. These technologies encompass a broad spectrum, including front-end development languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which determine the structure, style, and interactivity of a website, respectively. On the back end, server-side languages like Python, Ruby, and PHP, along with database management systems like MySQL and MongoDB, handle data processing and storage. Additionally, web frameworks such as React, Angular, and Django streamline development by providing pre-built components and structures. The evolution of web technologies continues to enhance user experiences, improve performance, and enable innovative web solutions. </p>
