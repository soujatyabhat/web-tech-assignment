    <h3> <u> CSS  (Cascading Style Sheets) </u></h3>
    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It enables web developers to separate content from design, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the layout, color, fonts, and overall look of web pages. CSS enhances the user experience by enabling responsive design, which adjusts the layout to different devices and screen sizes. It also supports the creation of visually appealing and consistent interfaces across multiple web pages.</p>
